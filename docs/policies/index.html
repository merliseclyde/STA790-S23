<blockquote>
<p>To uphold the <a href="https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard">Duke Community Standard</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;</li>

<li>I will act if the Standard is compromised.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

Such incidences will result in a 0 grade for all parties involved. Additionally, there may be penalties to your final class grade along with being reported to the Office of Student Conduct.

<h3 id="diversity--inclusiveness">Diversity &amp; Inclusiveness</h3>

<p>This course is designed so that students from all backgrounds and perspectives all feel welcome both in and out of class. Please feel free to talk to me (in person or via email) if you do not feel well-served by any aspect of this class, or if some aspect of class is not welcoming or accessible to you. My goal is for you to succeed in this course, therefore, let me know immediately if you feel you are struggling with any part of the course more than you know how to manage. Doing so will not affect your grades, but it will allow me to provide the resources to help you succeed in the course.</p>

<h3 id="disability-statement">Disability Statement</h3>

<p>Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in the class are encouraged to contact the <a href="https://access.duke.edu/students/staff.php">Student Disabilities Access Office</a> at 919-668-1267 or <a href="mailto:disabilities@aas.duke.edu">disabilities@aas.duke.edu</a> as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.</p>

<h3 id="other-information">Other Information</h3>

<p>It can be a lot more pleasant oftentimes to get one-on-one answers and help. Make use of the teaching team's office hours, we're here to help! Do not hesitate to talk to me during office hours or by appointment to discuss a problem set or any aspect of the course.  Questions related to course assignments and honesty policy should be directed to me. When the teaching team has announcements for you we will send an email to your Duke email address. Be sure to check your email daily.</p>

<p>Most of the course components will be held in person, but occasionally may need to be held online using Zoom meetings. If you have any concerns, issues or challenges, let the instructor know as soon as possible. Also, all students are strongly encouraged to rely on the forums in Sakai, for interacting among yourself and asking other students questions. You can also ask the instructor or the TAs questions on there and we will try to respond as soon as possible.  If you experience any technical issues with joining or using the forums, let the instructor know.</p>

<h3 id="professionalism">Professionalism</h3>

<p>Try as much as possible to refrain from texting or using your computer for anything other than coursework during class and labs Again, the more engaged you are, the quicker you will be able to get through the materials. You are responsible for everything covered in the lecture videos, lecture notes/slides, and in the assigned readings.</p>
